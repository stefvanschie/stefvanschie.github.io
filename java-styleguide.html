      <h1>Java Styleguide</h1>
      <p>This is a styleguide I created for java development. This is more for me as a reference, but if you like it you can of course use it too. This guide is based on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R_style">K&R style</a>, but more detailed.</p>
      <h2>Indention</h2>
      <p>The indention of code blocks (e.g. if/else if/else, try/catch, classes, for loops, (do/)while loops, methods) is as follows:</p>
      <div class="code">
        <p><span style="color:purple">if</span> {<br />} <span style="color:purple">else if</span> {<br />} <span style="color:purple">else</span> {<br />}</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Spacing</h2>
      <p>I find spacing one of the most important things of making your code readable. When not used propeely, or overused, code can become a real mess while it doesn't have to. So here are some rules about when you need an empty line.<br />An empty line should always be after your package declaration and after your imports. When your class starts an empty line should be there as well. Before and after every signle method there should be an empty line too. When declaring variables inside your class there should at least be empty lines surrounding the variables. Optional empty lines to divide different parts may be included. Inside methods you directly start without an empty line at the start or the end. When there is a code block inside a method (e.g. if/else if/else, try/catch, for loop, (do/)while loop etc) it should be surrounded with empty lines. Of course when doing a lot of other stuff this gets quite big so you should add an empty line when switching from something else in these situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Declaring/assigning variables</li>
        <li>Calling methods</li>
      </ul>
