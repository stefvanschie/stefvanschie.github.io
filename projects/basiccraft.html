      <h1>Projects - Basic Craft</h1>
      <p>Basic Craft is a line by line interpreted programming language. It's designed to be easy to use while still being in a programming environment. This should give younger/inexperienced people a way to learn programming while not having to learn a more complicated language like Java. This should also give busy server owners a way to change functionality of their server. Note that this should not be used for large scale projects, like minigames.</p>
