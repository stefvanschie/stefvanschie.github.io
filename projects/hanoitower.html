      <h1>Tower of Hanoi</h1>
      <p>Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle, invented in 1883. The idea is that you have three poles and a set of disks on the first pole. Your goal is to move the entire tower of disks to either the second or third pole. There are some restrictions, though. You can only move one disk at the time and this disk is the top one. You cannot place a bigger disk onto a smaller disk. See if you can work this out. To play simple click on the arrow underneath a pole to select it and click on a different arrow to move it to there.</p>
